# Activity: Street or Road?

## Instructions 

- **IMPORTANT: Read the rubric below carefully** as you will complete a modification of the Street or Road? Activity found in the Data Computing eBook. 
- Many tasks in the activity should have narrative text describing your observations; most steps also require code chunks and corresponding output.
- Each student will submit the activity individually to Canvas, but students are encouraged to help one another complete the work.
- Submit the completed R Notebook to Canvas before deadline.


## Grading

##### The assignment is worth a total of 15 points.

- Turn in your HTML R Notebook in Canvas before the due date.
- [2 points] Work through the "Solved Example" section using the voter addresses dataset as shown in the eBook, showing progress with each step.
- [3 points] State how many addresses are found in the voter dataset and how many addresses are found in the medicare service providers dataset. Then state how many match in both data sources (hint: which join can help us do this?). Then create a **combined** address dataset using bind_rows().
- "Back to the Streets" Section - **pay attention to what dataset to use**:
    - [2 points] Your Turn #1: Explain each line of code in English (either narrative or commented code).
    - [2 points] Your Turn #2: Implement your method **on the COMBINED address dataset** : expand to match several more patterns (at least 12 total).
    - [2 points] Your Turn #2: Present your result by providing a table in **descending order** of popularity for the street name endings you found **for the COMBINED address dataset** of voters and medicare service providers.
    - [2 points] Your Turn #2: Present your result by using `ggplot` to construct two bar charts, **one for EACH dataset**, in **descending order** of popularity for the street name endings you found previously.
    - [2 points] Your Turn #2: Present your result by writing a few sentences to **compare and contrast** the types of street endings common among the two address sources (e.g., similarities and differences among common street endings for voters & medicare service providers).
    - There's nothing to do in the "For the professional..." section at the very end except to be impressed.
